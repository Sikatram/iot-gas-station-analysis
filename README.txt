The goal of this program is to detect possible suspicious activity at Gas Stations 
-- specifically internal and external bluetooth devices that steal customer information at gas pumps

This program reads csv files exported from the mobile application BLE Scanner

The csv files included in this project were collected by myself by going to gas stations around the San Diego area

Each file's time spans approximately 20 minutes

Two files were generated at Mobil stations -- (one in downtown San Diego and one in San Diego County's outskirts)
The other file, varso_gas.csv, was generated in a rural area and not as commercial as the Mobil brand

Run $python main.py to see results

To test your own, use the app, export the csv files, and have their directories inserted into the methods
